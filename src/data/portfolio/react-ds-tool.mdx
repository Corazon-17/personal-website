## Introduction
**React DS-Tool** is react version of open source [data science tool](https://corazon17.vercel.app/portfolio/ds-tool) i've built before. It basically has the same features as the previous app, but runs in different environment. You might be wondering why i rebuilt the application that i made before. Well, first reason is because i wanna do it while learning about javascript and typescript. It's just more fun to learn by doing (that's why i mostly write the utility functions from scratch). Second reason is because i feel python is a little bit laggy, and the streamlit server (where you deploy streamlit app) refresh the web page very frequently in the middle of the user activity, which is so annoying. And the last one is because streamlit is less interactive.

I will work on this application as a long term project. There are still a lot of features that I have to work on and optimize. I also have to think about the right UI/UX design so that the user feels comfortable. So yeah, i'll do my best for this project.

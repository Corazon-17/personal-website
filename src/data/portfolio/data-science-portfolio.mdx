## Introduction

I used to be very interested in data science before deciding to
change my focus to web development. Doing data analysis by looking
for patterns in the data is very enjoyable for me. by knowing the
patterns that exist in the data, we will be able to determine what
to do with the data. This process is very important because it will
greatly affect the results and decisions that will be taken in the future,
so we must be very careful in doing so. So often this process will take
longer than other processes.

In data science, there is also a process called model optimization. 
Performing model optimization also has its own challenges to find the 
right combination of variables in the data and the model to be used. 
The purpose of this process is to improve prediction accuracy and minimize 
error. So far, learning data science has taught me to think critically and 
see things not only from one side.

## Portfolio List

Here are some portfolios that I made while studying data science.

- [Titanic Data Analysis and Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/corazon17/titanic-data-analysis-and-classification)
